# Homework

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The file `wildboar.gen` in the data folder contains microsatellite data for wild boar populations in Berlin and Brandenburg.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Urban sprawl has resulted in the permanent presence of large mammal species in urban and suburban areas, leading to humanâ€“wildlife conflicts. Wild boar *Sus scrofa* have established a permanent presence in many cities in Europe, with the largest German urban population occurring in Berlin. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The colonization and population structure of the wild boar in Berlin can be investigated using genetic markers.

# Tasks

Your mission, should you chose to accept it, is to run your `R` based analyses on this new data, and generate a report (= results + your interpretation).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clearly mark your interpretation using *Markdown* code. E.g. you can use **MY NAME: ....**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Populations**

Samples were collected in six localities in Berlin (sample ID starts with "B-") and five localities in Brandenburg (sample ID start with "BB-").

**Note:** You will need to rename the populations in your `myData`. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Be careful to not automatically remove loci/pops/individuals, as you did previously with the data from `lynx.gen`. Only remove them if warranted.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Questions**

1.) how many populations are there in Berlin?

2.) if there is more than one, were they colonized from the same source?

3.) is there anything noteworthy about the diversity of Berlin boars versus Brandenburg boars?
