# Homework

___

The file `lynx.gen` in the data folder contains microsatellite data for eight Eurasian lynx populations.

Here's a pretty pic, so we know what we're working on.

___

This large felid used to occur throughout Europe, but was virtually extinct in central and western Europe by the 19th century. 

In an effort to re-establish the species, lynx were re-introduced in some EU countries in the last decades.

You can see their distribution here on the IUCN webpage: https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/12519/121707666

___

Re-introductions frequently involve only a small number of animals. Especially, if they are dangerous! 

Having a small _founding population_ can impact genetic diversity:

- first of all, you are only introducing variation present in a few individuals

- second, not all introduced animals will mate (so variation will be lost)

- third, population size impacts the maintenance of variation. Small populations often lose variation due to genetic drift.


`lynx.gen` includes data for lynx from natural populations as well as re-introduced populations.

___

Not all of the re-introductions were documented. We can use genetics to try and figure out where re-introduced lynx originated.

___

# Tasks

Your mission, should you chose to accept it, is to run your `R` based analyses on this new data, and generate a report (= results + your interpretation).

___

Clearly mark your interpretation using _Markdown_ code. E.g. you can use __MY NAME: ....__.

___

__Population names__

The eight populations come from:

- Estonia
- Latvia
- Poland
- Russia
- Slovenia
- Croatia
- France
- Slovakia

They are in this order in the file.

__Note:__ You will need to rename the populations in your `myData` accordingly.

You can check that you have named them correctly, because the sample ID gives a clue as to where the samples are from.

___

Be careful to not automatically remove loci/pops/individuals, as you did previously with the data from `nancy.gen`. Only remove them if warranted.

___

### __Natural vs re-introduced populations__

Lynx from Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Russia and Slovakia are from natural populations.

Lynx from Slovenia, Croatia and France come from re-introduced populations.

.

__QUESTION: How do these types of populations differ?__ 

___

### __Subspecies__

Eurasian lynx in Europe belong to two subspecies: Lynx lynx lynx, and L. l. carpathicus.

_L. l. lynx:_

- Estonia
- Latvia
- Poland
- Russia


_L. l. carpathicus:_

- Slovenia
- Croatia
- Slovakia

.

__QUESTION: Can you tell to which subspecies does the French lynx belong?__

___
