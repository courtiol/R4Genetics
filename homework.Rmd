# Homework

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The file `lynx.gen` in the data folder contains microsatellite data for eight Eurasian lynx populations.

Here's a pretty pic, so we know what we're working on.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This large felid used to occur throughout Europe, but was virtually extinct in central and western Europe by the 19th century.

In an effort to re-establish the species, lynx were re-introduced in some EU countries in the last decades.

You can see their distribution here on the IUCN web page: <https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/12519/121707666>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Re-introductions frequently involve only a small number of animals. Especially, if they are dangerous!

Having a small *founding population* can impact genetic diversity:

-   first of all, you are only introducing variation present in a few individuals

-   second, not all introduced animals will mate (so variation will be lost)

-   third, population size impacts the maintenance of variation. Small populations often lose variation due to genetic drift.

`lynx.gen` includes data for lynx from natural populations as well as re-introduced populations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Not all of the re-introductions were documented. We can use genetics to try and figure out where re-introduced lynx originated.

# Tasks

Your mission, should you chose to accept it, is to run your `R` based analyses on this new data, and generate a report (= results + your interpretation).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clearly mark your interpretation using *Markdown* code. E.g. you can use **MY NAME: ....**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Population names**

The eight populations come from:

-   Estonia
-   Latvia
-   Poland
-   Russia
-   Slovenia
-   Croatia
-   France
-   Slovakia

They are in this order in the file.

**Note:** You will need to rename the populations in your `myData` accordingly.

You can check that you have named them correctly, because the sample ID gives a clue as to where the samples are from.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Be careful to not automatically remove loci/pops/individuals, as you did previously with the data from `nancy.gen`. Only remove them if warranted.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Natural vs re-introduced populations**

Lynx from Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Russia and Slovakia are from natural populations.

Lynx from Slovenia, Croatia and France come from re-introduced populations.

.

**QUESTION: How do these types of populations differ?**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Subspecies**

Eurasian lynx in Europe belong to two subspecies: Lynx lynx lynx, and L. l. carpathicus.

*L. l. lynx:*

-   Estonia
-   Latvia
-   Poland
-   Russia

*L. l. carpathicus:*

-   Slovenia
-   Croatia
-   Slovakia

.

**QUESTION: Can you tell to which subspecies does the French lynx belong?**
